    <p><h2><strong>ingrediants</strong></h2></p>
    <ul>
        <li>2 pounds Yukon gold potatoes or russet potatoes, peeled.</il>
        <li>1 yellow onion, peeled and halved.</il>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt, divided.</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper.</li>
        <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper.</li>
        <li>1/2 cup olive oil, divided.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong><h3>Directions</h3></strong></p>

    <p><ol>
        <li><p><strong>Step 1</strong></p>
            <p>-Slice potatoes and onions with a very sharp knife or mandoline into 1/8-inch thick slices.</p></li> 
        <li><p><strong>Step 2</strong></p>
            <p>-  Combine eggs, 1/2 teaspoon salt, black pepper, and cayenne in a large bowl and whisk very thoroughly; set aside.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Step 3</strong></p>
            <p>-  Add 1/3 cup olive oil to a large nonstick pan and set heat to medium-high. Add potatoes, onions, and remaining salt.</p>
            <p>   Cook, tossing and stirring occasionally, until potatoes are tender, and some onions and potatoes are lightly browned,</p>
            <p>   about 20 minutes. Between stirrings, cover potatoes to reduce cooking time and keep in moisture. For less browning,</p>
            <p>   reduce heat to medium.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Step 4</strong></p>
            <p>-Stir potato mixture into egg mixture with a spatula. Cover and let stand for 5 to 10 minutes.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Step 5</strong></p>
            <p>-Add remaining olive oil to an 8- or 9-inch nonstick pan, and set the pan over medium-high heat. Pour in egg and potato</p>
            <p>mixture, and smooth the top. Cook, covered, for about 4 minutes or until the bottom is browned and the edges of tortilla</p>
            <p>begin to firm up.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Step 6</strong></p>
            <p>-Slide tortilla out onto a plate, cover with another plate, and flip the plates over to invert. Slide tortilla back into</p>
            <p>the pan, and place back over medium-high heat.</p></li>   
        <li><p><strong>Step 7</strong></p>
            <p>-Cook, uncovered, until the tortilla is fully set, about 2 minutes more. Tortilla will spring back lightly when pressed in</p>
            <p>the middle with a finger if eggs are fully cooked. If it feels soft or mushy when pressed, cook for a few minutes more,</p>
            <p>unless you prefer the tortilla less than fully set.</p></li>  
        <li><p><strong>Step 7</strong></p>
            <p>-Slip tortilla onto a serving plate, and serve hot, warm, or room temperature.</p></li>    
        </ol></p>
